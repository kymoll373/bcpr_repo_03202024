October to November 2023 BCPR Commentary

Fannie 30y BCPR3 speeds decreased by -8.7% to 4.52 CPR from 4.95 last month.  FN15y BCPR3 speeds declined by -7.0% to 4.80 CPR from 5.16 CPR.  
As expected, speeds slowed in November.  Day counts and seasonality will be the primary story for the next few months unless something unforeseen occurs.
 

BCPR30y speeds for both GSEâ€™s remain tightly aligned.  BCPR3 15y speeds are trending lower and the Freddie speeds continue to be slightly higher than Fannie.  No meaningful change to the BCPR3 risk metrics between Fannie and Freddie.
